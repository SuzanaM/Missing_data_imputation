Missing data imputation

This repository has Python and R files used for comparative analysis of different methods for missing data imputation. 
These files were primarily used for amputation and imputatuon of data in iris data set, but they can be easily transformed for different data sets. 
Script MCAR is used for missing completely at random amputation and script NMAR is used for non missing at random amputation.
Scripts CV_BPCA, CV_PMM and CV_KNN are used for imputation of data using Bayesian Principle Component Analysis, Predictive mean matching and K Nearest Neighbours. CV stands for crossvalidation, because validation set was used for determing optimal hyperparameters.
Script SVM_test is used for classification using Support Vector Machines.
